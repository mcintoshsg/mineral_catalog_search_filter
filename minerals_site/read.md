Allow filtering by the first letter of the mineral name.
Add links for each letter of the alphabet. This should be added to the layout 
template so that it appears on every page. When a letter is clicked, a list of
minerals that start with that letter should be displayed in the list view. 
The letter of the alphabet currently being displayed should be bolded. 
In the details view, no letter should be bolded. On the homepage, 
select ‘A’ by default.

Allow text search.
Add a search box and button. The search box and button should be implemented 
as a form. When the search button is clicked, the site will search for minerals 
whose name contains the search text. The names of the minerals that match the 
search will be displayed in the list view. Add the search form to the layout 
template so that searching can be performed from any page in the site.

Allow filtering by group.
Add the ability to filter the list of minerals by adding links to these groups 
on the left side of the layout template. Clicking a group name, displays a
list of all of the minerals in the database that are in that group. 
The group name being displayed should be bolded. In the details view, 
no group name should be bolded.
